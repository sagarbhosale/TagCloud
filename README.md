TagCloud

Server-side dynamic tag cloud

What's different in this TagCloud?
  In short - Works across browsers and across devices! :)

Here's the not-so-short answer, for those who care. :P
  There are hundreds, if not thousands, of tag cloud creating client side scripts using JavaScript and/or HTML5. While they look fairly good and do a decent job, the problem with them is they work ONLY IN SOME browsers. Because every browsers runs JavaScript differently. Though there are JavaScript libraries which can detect the browser in order to use the appropriate API, the overhead of checking the browser still exists. Plus, you never know which browser will beat the rest tomorrow.

  So, instead of depending on the browser we can ask the server to provide us with a tag cloud. No matter what rendering techniques your browser uses, it will not mess much with the way an image is handled. This is the reason TagCloud JUST WORKS ( it HAS to ) across browsers and across devices.
