{"name":"TagCloud","tagline":"Server-side dynamic tag cloud","body":"### What's different in this TagCloud?\r\nIn short - Works across browsers and across devices! :)\r\n\r\n**Here's the not-so-short answer, for those who care. :P**<br/>\r\nThere are hundreds, if not thousands, of tag cloud creating client side scripts using JavaScript and/or HTML5. While they look fairly good and do a decent job, the problem with them is they work ONLY IN SOME browsers. Because every browsers runs JavaScript differently. Though there are JavaScript libraries which can detect the browser in order to use the appropriate API, the overhead of checking the browser still exists. Plus, you never know which browser will beat the rest tomorrow.\r\n\r\nSo, instead of depending on the browser we can ask the server to provide us with a tag cloud. No matter what rendering techniques your browser uses, it will not mess much with the way an image is handled. This is the reason TagCloud JUST WORKS ( it HAS to ) across browsers and across devices.\r\n\r\n## Demo Page\r\n```\r\n[www.sagarbhosale.com/demo/TagCloud-master/example.php](http://www.sagarbhosale.com/demo/TagCloud-master/example.php)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\nTagCloud needs PHP with the GD Library.<br/>\r\nThe code has been tested on PHP 5.2.12 with php_gd2.dll (extension for Windows) served by Apache 2.2\r\n\r\n## Installing the GD library\r\nYou will need to install the GD Library if it is unavailable on your system.\r\n### For Linux (Ubuntu with PHP5)\r\nRun the command\r\n```sh\r\napt-get install php5-gd\r\n```\r\nThis should place the gd.so file inside your PHP extensions directory. If PHP is still unable to find the library, then check whether the following line exists (and is uncommented) in your php.ini file.\r\n```\r\nextension=gd.so\r\n```\r\n### For Windows\r\n1. Check if php_gd2.dll exists in your PHP extension folder. If not, download it and add it to the PHP extensions folder.\r\n2. Add/Uncomment the line in your php.ini file.\r\n```\r\nextension=php_gd2.dll\r\n```\r\nFor those have hosted their code on a shared server, you will have to consult with the hosting provider. They will help you get the library.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n### Setup\r\n1. Download the code\r\n2. Copy the contents of the TagCloud/images directory into the directory where you keep your public images.\r\n3. Copy TagCloud/include/TagCloudProvider.php at any location favorable and accessible to your PHP script in which you want to use TagCloud.\r\n\r\n### Including the classes\r\nInclude the provider class as follows.\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\n\trequire \"include/TagCloudProvider.php\";\r\n\t$tg = new TagCloudProvider(\"images/tagCloud.php\");\r\n?>\r\n```\r\nHere, \"images/tagCloud.php\" is the path of the tagCloud.php file we copied earlier. You will need to set it as per your directory structure.\r\n\r\n### Getting the image\r\n```php\r\n<?php \r\n\r\n$tg->create(\r\n    300,\r\n    200,\r\n    Array(\r\n        'C',\r\n        'C++',\r\n        'Java',\r\n        'x86 Assembly',\r\n        'PHP',\r\n        'MySQL',\r\n        'XML',\r\n        'Linux'\r\n        )\r\n);\r\n\r\n?>\r\n```\r\nHere:<br/>\r\nImage width is 300px<br/>\r\nImage height is 200px<br/>\r\nArray contains the words to be added to the cloud\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nTagCloud is authored and maintained by @sagarbhosale.<br/>\r\nPersonal Homepage: [www.sagarbhosale.com](http://www.sagarbhosale.com/)<br/>\r\nEmail: [sagar@codenext.co.in](mailto:sagar@codenext.co.in)","google":"UA-39633337-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
